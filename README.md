# RandomForest1

Here, we have data from four companies in different industries. We are trying to predict the price using random forest. 
We use decision tree and embedding to make the model effective and usable. 
Several momentum indicators such as Relative Strength index and stochastic Oscillator are used.
The predictions are made for several months.
Enjoy!
